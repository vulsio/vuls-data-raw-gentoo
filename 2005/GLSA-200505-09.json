    "Text": "\n    <p>\n    Stu Tomlinson discovered that Gaim is vulnerable to a remote stack\n    based buffer overflow when receiving messages in certain protocols,\n    like Jabber and SILC, with a very long URL (CAN-2005-1261). Siebe\n    Tolsma discovered that Gaim is also vulnerable to a remote Denial of\n    Service attack when receiving a specially crafted MSN message\n    (CAN-2005-1262).\n    </p>\n  "

  "Impact": {
    "Type": "high",
    "Text": "\n    <p>\n    A remote attacker could cause a buffer overflow by sending an\n    instant message with a very long URL, potentially leading to the\n    execution of malicious code. By sending a SLP message with an empty\n    body, a remote attacker could cause a Denial of Service or crash of the\n    Gaim client.\n    </p>\n  "
