		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    ClamAV is a GPL anti-virus toolkit, designed for integration with mail\n    servers to perform attachment scanning. ClamAV also provides a command\n    line scanner and a tool for fetching updates of the virus database.\n    </p>\n  "

	"Description": {
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    ClamAV has multiple security flaws: a boundary check was performed\n    incorrectly in petite.c, a buffer size calculation in unfsg_133 was\n    incorrect in fsg.c, a possible infinite loop was fixed in tnef.c and a\n    possible infinite loop in cabd_find was fixed in cabd.c . In addition\n    to this, Marcin Owsiany reported that a corrupted DOC file causes a\n    segmentation fault in ClamAV.\n    </p>\n  "
