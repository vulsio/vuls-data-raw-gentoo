  "Description": {
    "Text": "\n    <p>\n    The following vulnerabilities were found and fixed in the Mozilla\n    Suite:\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n    <li>\"moz_bug_r_a4\" and \"shutdown\" discovered that the\n    Mozilla Suite was improperly cloning base objects (MFSA 2005-56).</li>\n    <li>\"moz_bug_r_a4\" reported that the suite failed to validate XHTML DOM\n    nodes properly (MFSA 2005-55).</li>\n    <li>Secunia reported that alerts\n    and prompts scripts are presented with the generic title [JavaScript\n    Application] which could lead to tricking a user (MFSA 2005-54).</li>\n    <li>Andreas Sandblad of Secunia reported that top.focus() can be called\n    in the context of a child frame even if the framing page comes from a\n    different origin and has overridden the focus() routine (MFSA\n    2005-52).</li>\n    <li>Secunia reported that a frame-injection spoofing bug\n    which was fixed in earlier versions, was accidently bypassed in Mozilla\n    Suite 1.7.7 (MFSA 2005-51).</li>\n    <li>\"shutdown\" reported that\n    InstallVersion.compareTo() might be exploitable. When it gets an object\n    rather than a string, the browser would generally crash with an access\n    violation (MFSA 2005-50).</li>\n    <li>Matthew Mastracci reported that by\n    forcing a page navigation immediately after calling the install method\n    can end up running in the context of the new page selected by the\n    attacker (MFSA 2005-48).</li>\n    <li>\"moz_bug_r_a4\" reported that XBL\n    scripts run even when Javascript is disabled (MFSA 2005-46).</li>\n    <li>\n    Omar Khan, Jochen, \"shutdown\" and Matthew Mastracci reported that the\n    Mozilla Suite incorrectly distinguished between true events like mouse\n    clicks or keystrokes and synthetic events generated by a web content\n    (MFSA 2005-45).</li>\n    </ul>\n  "
