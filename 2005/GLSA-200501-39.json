    "Text": "\n    <p>\n    SquirrelMail fails to properly sanitize certain strings when\n    decoding specially-crafted strings, which can lead to PHP file\n    inclusion and XSS.\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n    <li>Insufficient checking of incoming URLs\n    in prefs.php (CAN-2005-0075) and in webmail.php (CAN-2005-0103).</li>\n    <li>Insufficient escaping of integers in webmail.php\n    (CAN-2005-0104).</li>\n    </ul>\n  "
  },
  "Impact": {
    "Type": "high",
    "Text": "\n    <p>\n    By sending a specially-crafted URL, an attacker can execute\n    arbitrary code from the local system with the permissions of the web\n    server. Furthermore by enticing a user to load a specially-crafted URL,\n    it is possible to display arbitrary remote web pages in Squirrelmail's\n    frameset and execute arbitrary scripts running in the context of the\n    victim's browser. This could lead to a compromise of the user's webmail\n    account, cookie theft, etc.\n    </p>\n  "
  },
  "Workaround": {
    "Text": "\n    <p>\n    The arbitrary code execution is only possible with\n    \"register_globals\" set to \"On\". Gentoo ships PHP with\n    \"register_globals\" set to \"Off\" by default. There are no known\n    workarounds for the other issues at this time.\n    </p>\n  "
