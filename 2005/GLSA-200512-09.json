	"Description": {
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    Stefan Esser from the Hardened-PHP Project has reported a\n    vulnerability in cURL that allows for a local buffer overflow when cURL\n    attempts to parse specially crafted URLs. The URL can be specially\n    crafted in one of two ways: the URL could be malformed in a way that\n    prevents a terminating null byte from being added to either a hostname\n    or path buffer; or the URL could contain a \"?\" separator in the\n    hostname portion, which causes a \"/\" to be prepended to the resulting\n    string.\n    </p>\n  "
	},
	"Impact": {
		"Type": "low",
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    An attacker capable of getting cURL to parse a maliciously crafted\n    URL could cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code with the\n    privileges of the user making the call to cURL. An attacker could also\n    escape open_basedir or safe_mode pseudo-restrictions when exploiting\n    this problem from within a PHP program when PHP is compiled with\n    libcurl.\n    </p>\n  "
