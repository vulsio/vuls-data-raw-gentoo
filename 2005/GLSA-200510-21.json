    "Text": "\n    <p>\n    Stefan Esser discovered that by calling certain PHP files directly, it\n    was possible to workaround the grab_globals.lib.php security model and\n    overwrite the $cfg configuration array. Systems running PHP in safe\n    mode are not affected. Futhermore, Tobias Klein reported several\n    cross-site-scripting issues resulting from insufficient user input\n    sanitizing.\n    </p>\n  "

  "Impact": {
    "Type": "normal",
    "Text": "\n    <p>\n    A local attacker may exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious\n    requests, causing the execution of arbitrary code with the rights of\n    the user running the web server. Furthermore, the cross-site scripting\n    issues give a remote attacker the ability to inject and execute\n    malicious script code or to steal cookie-based authentication\n    credentials, potentially compromising the victim's browser.\n    </p>\n  "
