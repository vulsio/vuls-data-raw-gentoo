Furthermore a\n    remote attacker could gain access to sensitive information, disclose\n    memory contents by enticing a user to open a specially crafted PDF file\n    inside a Flash application, modify the victim's clipboard or render it\n    temporarily unusable, persuade a user into uploading or downloading\n    files, bypass security restrictions with the assistance of the user to\n    gain access to camera and microphone, conduct Cross-Site Scripting and\n    HTTP Header Splitting attacks, bypass the \"non-root domain policy\" of\n    Flash, and gain escalated privileges.\n    </p>\n  "
