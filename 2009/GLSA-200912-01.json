		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in OpenSSL:\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n    <li>Marsh Ray of PhoneFactor and Martin Rex of SAP independently\n    reported that the TLS protocol does not properly handle session\n    renegotiation requests (CVE-2009-3555).</li>\n    <li>The MD2 hash algorithm is no longer considered to be\n    cryptographically strong, as demonstrated by Dan Kaminsky. Certificates\n    using this algorithm are no longer accepted (CVE-2009-2409).</li>\n    <li>Daniel Mentz and Robin Seggelmann reported the following\n    vulnerabilities related to DTLS: A use-after-free flaw (CVE-2009-1379)\n    and a NULL pointer dereference (CVE-2009-1387) in the\n    dtls1_retrieve_buffered_fragment() function in src/d1_both.c, multiple\n    memory leaks in the dtls1_process_out_of_seq_message() function in\n    src/d1_both.c (CVE-2009-1378), and a processing error related to a\n    large amount of DTLS records with a future epoch in the\n    dtls1_buffer_record() function in ssl/d1_pkt.c\n    (CVE-2009-1377).</li>\n    </ul>\n  "

	"Impact": {
		"Type": "normal",
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    A remote unauthenticated attacker, acting as a Man in the Middle, could\n    inject arbitrary plain text into a TLS session, possibly leading to the\n    ability to send requests as if authenticated as the victim. A remote\n    attacker could furthermore send specially crafted DTLS packages to a\n    service using OpenSSL for DTLS support, possibly resulting in a Denial\n    of Service. Also, a remote attacker might be able to create rogue\n    certificates, facilitated by a MD2 collision. NOTE: The amount of\n    computation needed for this attack is still very large.\n    </p>\n  "
