NOTE: Successful exploitation requires the \"autokey\" feature\n    to be enabled. This feature is only available if NTP was built with the\n    'ssl' USE flag.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    Furthermore, a remote attacker could entice a user into connecting to a\n    malicious server using ntpq, possibly resulting in the remote execution\n    of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the\n    application, or a Denial of Service.\n    </p>\n  "
