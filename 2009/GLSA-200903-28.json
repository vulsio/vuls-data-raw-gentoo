That vulnerability affects direct uses of\n    png_read_png(), pCAL chunk and 16-bit gamma table handling\n    (CVE-2009-0040).</li>\n    </ul>\n  "

  "Impact": {
    "Type": "normal",
    "Text": "\n    <p>\n    A remote attacker may execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the\n    user opening a specially crafted PNG file by exploiting the erroneous\n    out-of-memory handling. An attacker may also exploit the\n    png_check_keyword() error to set arbitrary memory locations to 0, if\n    the application allows overlong, user-controlled keywords when writing\n    PNG files. The png_handle_tEXT() vulnerability may be exploited by an\n    attacker to potentially consume all memory on a users system when a\n    specially crafted PNG file is opened.\n    </p>\n  "
