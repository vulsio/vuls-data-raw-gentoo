  "Description": {
    "Text": "\n    <p>\n    Multiple vulnerabilities were found in the UW IMAP toolkit:\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n    <li>Aron Andersson and Jan Sahlin of Bitsec reported boundary errors in\n    the \"tmail\" and \"dmail\" utilities when processing overly long mailbox\n    names, leading to stack-based buffer overflows (CVE-2008-5005).</li>\n    <li>An error in smtp.c in the c-client library was found, leading to a\n    NULL pointer dereference vulnerability (CVE-2008-5006).</li>\n    <li>Ludwig\n    Nussel reported an off-by-one error in the rfc822_output_char()\n    function in the RFC822BUFFER routines in the c-client library, as used\n    by the UW IMAP toolkit (CVE-2008-5514).</li>\n    </ul>\n  "
  },
  "Impact": {
    "Type": "high",
    "Text": "\n    <p>\n    A remote attacker could send an e-mail to a destination mailbox name\n    composed of a username and '+' character followed by a long string,\n    possibly leading to the execution of arbitrary code. A local attacker\n    could gain privileges by specifying a long folder extension argument to\n    the tmail or dmail program. Furthermore, a remote attacker could send a\n    specially crafted mail message to the UW IMAP toolkit or another daemon\n    using the c-client library, leading to a Denial of Service. A remote\n    SMTP server could respond to the QUIT command with a close of the TCP\n    connection instead of the expected 221 response code, possibly leading\n    to a Denial of Service.\n    </p>\n  "
