		"Text": "\n    <p>cURL is a tool and libcurl is a library for transferring data with URL\n      syntax.\n    </p>\n  "

	"Description": {
		"Text": "\n    <p>cURL and applications linked against libcurl support “OCSP\n      stapling”, also known as the TLS Certificate Status Request extension\n      (using the CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYSTATUS option). When telling cURL to use\n      this feature, it uses that TLS extension to ask for a fresh proof of the\n      server’s certificate’s validity. If the server doesn’t support the\n      extension, or fails to provide said proof, cURL is expected to return an\n      error.\n      Due to a coding mistake, the code that checks for a test success or\n      failure, ends up always thinking there’s valid proof, even when there\n      is none or if the server doesn’t support the TLS extension in question.\n    </p>\n  "
