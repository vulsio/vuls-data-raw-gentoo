	"Background": {
		"Text": "\n    <p>Subversion is a version control system intended to eventually replace\n      CVS. Like CVS, it has an optional client-server architecture (where the\n      server can be an Apache server running mod_svn, or an ssh program as in\n      CVS’s :ext: method). In addition to supporting the features found in\n      CVS, Subversion also provides support for moving and copying files and\n      directories.\n    </p>\n  "
	},
	"Description": {
		"Text": "\n    <p>Specially crafted ‘ssh://...’ URLs may allow the owner of the\n      repository to execute arbitrary commands on client’s machine if those\n      commands are already installed on the client’s system. This is\n      especially dangerous when the third-party repository has one or more\n      submodules with specially crafted ‘ssh://...’ URLs. Each time the\n      repository is recursively cloned or submodules are updated the payload\n      will be triggered.\n    </p>\n  "

	"Impact": {
		"Type": "normal",
		"Text": "\n    <p>A remote attacker, by enticing a user to clone a specially crafted\n      repository, could possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of\n      the process.\n    </p>\n  "
