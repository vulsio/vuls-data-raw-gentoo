		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    The GNU Privacy Guard, GnuPG, is a free replacement for the PGP suite\n    of cryptographic software.\n    </p>\n  "
	},
	"Description": {
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    Hugh Warrington has reported a boundary error in GnuPG, in the\n    \"ask_outfile_name()\" function from openfile.c: the\n    make_printable_string() function could return a string longer than\n    expected. Additionally, Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Security Team\n    reported a design error in which a function pointer can be incorrectly\n    dereferenced.\n    </p>\n  "
	},
	"Impact": {
		"Type": "normal",
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    A remote attacker could entice a user to interactively use GnuPG on a\n    crafted file and trigger the boundary error, which will result in a\n    buffer overflow. They could also entice a user to process a signed or\n    encrypted file with gpg or gpgv, possibly called through another\n    application like a mail client, to trigger the dereference error. Both\n    of these vulnerabilities would result in the execution of arbitrary\n    code with the permissions of the user running GnuPG. gpg-agent, gpgsm\n    and other tools are not affected.\n    </p>\n  "
