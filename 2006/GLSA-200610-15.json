	"Background": {
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    Asterisk is an open source implementation of a telephone private branch\n    exchange (PBX).\n    </p>\n  "
	},
	"Description": {
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    Asterisk contains buffer overflows in channels/chan_mgcp.c from the\n    MGCP driver and in channels/chan_skinny.c from the Skinny channel\n    driver for Cisco SCCP phones. It also dangerously handles\n    client-controlled variables to determine filenames in the Record()\n    function. Finally, the SIP channel driver in channels/chan_sip.c could\n    use more resources than necessary under unspecified circumstances.\n    </p>\n  "
	},
	"Impact": {
		"Type": "high",
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    A remote attacker could execute arbitrary code by sending a crafted\n    audit endpoint (AUEP) response, by sending an overly large Skinny\n    packet even before authentication, or by making use of format strings\n    specifiers through the client-controlled variables. An attacker could\n    also cause a Denial of Service by resource consumption through the SIP\n    channel driver.\n    </p>\n  "
	},
	"Workaround": {
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    There is no known workaround for the format strings vulnerability at\n    this time. You can comment the lines in /etc/asterisk/mgcp.conf,\n    /etc/asterisk/skinny.conf and /etc/asterisk/sip.conf to deactivate the\n    three vulnerable channel drivers. Please note that the MGCP channel\n    driver is disabled by default.\n    </p>\n  "
