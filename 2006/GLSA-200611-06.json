		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    Tavis Ormandy of the Google Security Team has discovered a\n    pre-authentication vulnerability, causing sshd to spin until the login\n    grace time has been expired. Mark Dowd found an unsafe signal handler\n    that was vulnerable to a race condition. It has also been discovered\n    that when GSSAPI authentication is enabled, GSSAPI will in certain\n    cases incorrectly abort.\n    </p>\n  "
