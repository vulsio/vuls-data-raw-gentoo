		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    The Ruby on Rails developers have corrected some weaknesses in\n    action_controller/, relative to the handling of the user input and the\n    LOAD_PATH variable. A remote attacker could inject arbitrary entries\n    into the LOAD_PATH variable and alter the main Ruby on Rails process.\n    The security hole has only been partly solved in version 1.1.5.
