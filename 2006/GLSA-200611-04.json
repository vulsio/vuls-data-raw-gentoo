Additionally, it was\n    discovered that the \"deadline\" field is visible to users who do not\n    belong to the \"timetrackinggroup\" when bugs are exported to XML\n    (CVE-2006-5454).</li>\n    <li>Gavin Shelley reported that Bugzilla allows certain operations to\n    be performed via HTTP GET and HTTP POST requests without verifying\n    those requests properly (CVE-2006-5455).</li>\n    <li>Max Kanat-Alexander discovered that input passed to\n    showdependencygraph.cgi is not properly sanitized before being returned\n    to users (CVE-2006-5453).</li>\n    </ul>\n  "

    "Text": "\n    <p>\n    An attacker could inject scripts into the content loaded by a user's\n    browser in order to have those scripts executed in a user's browser in\n    the context of the site currently being viewed. This could include\n    gaining access to privileged session information for the site being\n    viewed. Additionally, a user could forge an HTTP request in order to\n    create, modify, or delete bugs within a Bugzilla instance. Lastly, an\n    unauthorized user could view sensitive information about bugs or bug\n    attachments.\n    </p>\n  "
