D. Moore reported a testcase that was able to\n    trigger a race condition where JavaScript garbage collection deleted a\n    temporary variable still being used in the creation of a new Function\n    object.</li>\n    <li>A malicious page can hijack native DOM methods on a\n    document object in another domain, which will run the attacker's script\n    when called by the victim page.</li>\n    <li>Secunia Research has\n    discovered a vulnerability which is caused due to an memory corruption\n    error within the handling of simultaneously happening XPCOM events.\n    This leads to use of a deleted timer object.</li>\n    </ul>\n  "
