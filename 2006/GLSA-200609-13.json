	"Description": {
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    Tavis Ormandy of the Google Security Team has reported multiple\n    vulnerabilities in gzip. A stack buffer modification vulnerability was\n    discovered in the LZH decompression code, where a pathological data\n    stream may result in the modification of stack data such as frame\n    pointer, return address or saved registers. A static buffer underflow\n    was discovered in the pack decompression support, allowing a specially\n    crafted pack archive to underflow a .bss buffer. A static buffer\n    overflow was uncovered in the LZH decompression code, allowing a data\n    stream consisting of pathological huffman codes to overflow a .bss\n    buffer. Multiple infinite loops were also uncovered in the LZH\n    decompression code.\n    </p>\n  "
	},
	"Impact": {
		"Type": "normal",
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    A remote attacker may create a specially crafted gzip archive, which\n    when decompressed by a user or automated system exectues arbitrary code\n    with the privileges of the user id invoking gzip. The infinite loops\n    may be abused by an attacker to disrupt any automated systems invoking\n    gzip to handle data decompression.\n    </p>\n  "
