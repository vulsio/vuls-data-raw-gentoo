If\n    Sendmail is not set to use a randomized queue processing, the attack\n    will effectively halt the delivery of queued mails as well as the\n    malformed one, incoming mail delivered interactively is not affected.\n    Additionally, on systems where core dumps with an individual naming\n    scheme (like \"core.pid\") are enabled, a filesystem may fill up with\n    core dumps. Core dumps are disabled by default in Gentoo.\n    </p>\n  "
