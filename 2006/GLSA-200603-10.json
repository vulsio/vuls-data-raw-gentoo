		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    Luigi Auriemma reported that Cube is vulnerable to a buffer\n    overflow in the sgetstr() function (CVE-2006-1100) and that the\n    sgetstr() and getint() functions fail to verify the length of the\n    supplied argument, possibly leading to the access of invalid memory\n    regions (CVE-2006-1101). Furthermore, he discovered that a client\n    crashes when asked to load specially crafted mapnames (CVE-2006-1102).\n    </p>\n  "
