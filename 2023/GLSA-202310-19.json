These incorrectly applied settings can lead to an unintended security configuration and can permit privilege escalation with certain configurations involving master user authentication.\r\n\r\nDovecot documentation does not advise against the use of passdb definitions which have the same driver and args settings. One such configuration would be where an administrator wishes to use the same pam configuration or passwd file for both normal and master users but use the username_filter setting to restrict which of the users is able to be a master user.</p>\n    "
