Specifically,\n    the processing of such fields is stopped at the first occurrence of a\n    NUL character. This type of vulnerability was recently discovered by\n    Dan Kaminsky and Moxie Marlinspike (CVE-2009-2666).</li>\n    </ul>\n  "

NOTE: The issue is only existent on\n    platforms on which char is signed.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    Furthermore, a remote attacker might employ a specially crafted X.509\n    certificate, containing a NUL character in the Common Name field to\n    conduct man-in-the-middle attacks on SSL connections made using\n    Fetchmail.\n    </p>\n  "
