  "Description": {
    "Text": "\n    <p>\n    On 64-bit big-endian platforms, mod_access does not properly parse\n    Allow/Deny rules using IP addresses without a netmask which could result in\n    failure to match certain IP addresses.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    Terminal escape sequences are not filtered from error logs. This could be\n    used by an attacker to insert escape sequences into a terminal emulater\n    vulnerable to escape sequences.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    mod_digest does not properly verify the nonce of a client response by using\n    a AuthNonce secret. This could permit an attacker to replay the response of\n    another website. This does not affect mod_auth_digest.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    On certain platforms there is a starvation issue where listening sockets\n    fails to handle short-lived connection on a rarely-accessed listening\n    socket. This causes the child to hold the accept mutex and block out new\n    connections until another connection arrives on the same rarely-accessed\n    listening socket thus leading to a denial of service.\n    </p>\n  "
