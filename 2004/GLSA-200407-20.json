	"Background": {
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    Subversion is an advanced version control system, similar to CVS, which\n    supports additional functionality such as the ability to move, copy and\n    delete files and directories. A Subversion server may be run as an\n    Apache module, a standalone server (svnserve), or on-demand over ssh (a\n    la CVS' \":ext:\" protocol). The mod_authz_svn Apache module works with\n    Subversion in Apache to limit access to parts of Subversion\n    repositories based on policy set by the administrator.\n    </p>\n  "
	},
	"Description": {
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    Users with write access to part of a Subversion repository may bypass\n    read restrictions on any part of that repository. This can be done\n    using an \"svn copy\" command to copy the portion of a repository the\n    user wishes to read into an area where they have write access.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    Since copies are versioned, any such copy attempts will be readily\n    apparent.\n    </p>\n  "
	},
	"Impact": {
		"Type": "low",
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    This is a low-risk vulnerability. It affects only users of Subversion\n    who are running servers inside Apache and using mod_authz_svn.\n    Additionally, this vulnerability may be exploited only by users with\n    write access to some portion of a repository.\n    </p>\n  "
	},
	"Workaround": {
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    Keep sensitive content separated into different Subversion\n    repositories, or disable the Apache Subversion server and use svnserve\n    instead.\n    </p>\n  "
