	"Description": {
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    A password extended operation (password EXOP) which fails will cause\n    the slapd server to free() an uninitialized pointer, possibly resulting\n    in a segfault. This only affects servers using the back-ldbm backend.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    Such a crash is not guaranteed with every failed operation, however, it\n    is possible.\n    </p>\n  "
