	"Background": {
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    CVS, which stands for Concurrent Versions System, is a client/server\n    application which tracks changes to sets of files. It allows multiple\n    users to work concurrently on files, and then merge their changes back\n    into the main tree (which can be on a remote system). It also allows\n    branching, or maintaining separate versions for files.\n    </p>\n  "
	},
	"Description": {
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    There are two vulnerabilities in CVS; one in the server and one in the\n    client. The server vulnerability allows a malicious client to request\n    the contents of any RCS file to which the server has permission, even\n    those not located under $CVSROOT. The client vulnerability allows a\n    malicious server to overwrite files on the client machine anywhere the\n    client has permissions.\n    </p>\n  "
