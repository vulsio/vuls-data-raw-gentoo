  "Background": {
    "Text": "\n    <p>\n    Subversion is a revision control system that aims to be a \"compelling\n    replacement for CVS\". It enjoys wide use in the open source community.\n    svnserve allows access to Subversion repositories using URIs with the\n    svn://, svn+ssh://, and other tunelled svn+*:// protocols.\n    </p>\n  "
  },
  "Description": {
    "Text": "\n    <p>\n    The svn protocol parser trusts the indicated length of a URI string sent by\n    a client. This allows a client to specify a very long string, thereby\n    causing svnserve to allocate enough memory to hold that string. This may\n    cause a Denial of Service. Alternately, given a string that causes an\n    integer overflow in the variable holding the string length, the server\n    might allocate less memory than required, allowing a heap overflow. This\n    heap overflow may then be exploitable, allowing remote code execution. The\n    attacker does not need read or write access to the Subversion repository\n    being served, since even un-authenticated users can send svn protocol\n    requests.\n    </p>\n  "

  "Impact": {
    "Type": "high",
    "Text": "\n    <p>\n    Ranges from remote Denial of Service to potential arbitrary code execution\n    with privileges of the svnserve process.\n    </p>\n  "
  },
  "Workaround": {
    "Text": "\n    <p>\n    Servers without svnserve running are not vulnerable. Disable svnserve and\n    use DAV for access instead.\n    </p>\n  "
