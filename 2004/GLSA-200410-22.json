  "Description": {
    "Text": "\n    <p>\n    The following vulnerabilities were found and fixed in MySQL:\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    Oleksandr Byelkin found that ALTER TABLE ... RENAME checks CREATE/INSERT\n    rights of the old table instead of the new one (CAN-2004-0835). Another\n    privilege checking bug allowed users to grant rights on a database they had\n    no rights on.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    Dean Ellis found a defect where multiple threads ALTERing the MERGE tables\n    to change the UNION could cause the server to crash (CAN-2004-0837).\n    Another crash was found in MATCH ... AGAINST() queries with missing closing\n    double quote.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    Finally, a buffer overrun in the mysql_real_connect function was found by\n    Lukasz Wojtow (CAN-2004-0836).\n    </p>\n  "
  },
  "Impact": {
    "Type": "high",
    "Text": "\n    <p>\n    The privilege checking issues could be used by remote users to bypass their\n    rights on databases. The two crashes issues could be exploited by a remote\n    user to perform a Denial of Service attack on MySQL server. The buffer\n    overrun issue could also be exploited as a Denial of Service attack, and\n    may allow to execute arbitrary code with the rights of the MySQL daemon\n    (typically, the \"mysql\" user).\n    </p>\n  "
