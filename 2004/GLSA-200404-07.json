The main purpose\n    of this software is the integration with mail servers (attachment\n    scanning). The package provides a flexible and scalable multi-threaded\n    daemon, a command line scanner, and a tool for automatic updating via\n    Internet. The programs are based on a shared library distributed with\n    the Clam AntiVirus package, which you can use with your own software.\n    Most importantly, the virus database is kept up to date.\"\n    </p>\n  "
