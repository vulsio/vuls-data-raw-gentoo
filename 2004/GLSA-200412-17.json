		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    KDE is a feature-rich graphical desktop environment for Linux and\n    Unix-like Operating Systems. kfax (part of kdegraphics) is the KDE fax\n    file viewer.\n    </p>\n  "

		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    Than Ngo discovered that kfax contains a private copy of the TIFF\n    library and is therefore subject to several known vulnerabilities (see\n    References).\n    </p>\n  "

		"Type": "normal",
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    A remote attacker could entice a user to view a carefully-crafted TIFF\n    image file with kfax, which would potentially lead to execution of\n    arbitrary code with the rights of the user running kfax.\n    </p>\n  "
