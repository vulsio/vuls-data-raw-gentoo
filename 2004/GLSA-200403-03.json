	"Description": {
		"Text": "\n    <ol>\n    <li>\n    Testing performed by the OpenSSL group using the Codenomicon TLS Test\n    Tool uncovered a null-pointer assignment in the do_change_cipher_spec()\n    function. A remote attacker could perform a carefully crafted SSL/TLS\n    handshake against a server that used the OpenSSL library in such a way\n    as to cause OpenSSL to crash. Depending on the application this could\n    lead to a denial of service. All versions of OpenSSL from 0.9.6c to\n    0.9.6l inclusive and from 0.9.7a to 0.9.7c inclusive are affected by\n    this issue.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    A flaw has been discovered in SSL/TLS handshaking code when using\n    Kerberos ciphersuites. A remote attacker could perform a carefully\n    crafted SSL/TLS handshake against a server configured to use Kerberos\n    ciphersuites in such a way as to cause OpenSSL to crash. Most\n    applications have no ability to use Kerberos cipher suites and will\n    therefore be unaffected. Versions 0.9.7a, 0.9.7b, and 0.9.7c of OpenSSL\n    are affected by this issue.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    Testing performed by the OpenSSL group using the Codenomicon TLS Test\n    Tool uncovered a bug in older versions of OpenSSL 0.9.6 that can lead\n    to a Denial of Service attack (infinite loop). This issue was traced to\n    a fix that was added to OpenSSL 0.9.6d some time ago. This issue will\n    affect vendors that ship older versions of OpenSSL with backported\n    security patches.\n    </li>\n    </ol>\n  "
