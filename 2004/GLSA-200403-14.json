  },
  "Description": {
    "Text": "\n    <p>\n    A denial of service may occur due to Monit not sanitizing remotely\n    supplied HTTP parameters before passing them to memory allocation\n    functions. This could allow an attacker to cause an unexpected\n    condition that could lead to the Monit daemon crashing.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    An overly long http request method may cause a buffer overflow due to\n    Monit performing insufficient bounds checking when handling HTTP\n    requests.\n    </p>\n  "

  "Impact": {
    "Type": "high",
    "Text": "\n    <p>\n    An attacker may crash the Monit daemon to create a denial of service\n    condition or cause a buffer overflow that would allow arbitrary code to\n    be executed with root privileges.\n    </p>\n  "
