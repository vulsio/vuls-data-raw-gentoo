It runs as non-root for most of the time, and uses the\n    Unix chroot() command to hide most of the systems directories from\n    external users - they cannot change into them even if the server is\n    totally compromised! It contains its own directory change code, so that\n    it can run efficiently as a threaded server, and its own directory\n    listing code (most FTP servers execute the system \"ls\" command to list\n    files).\"\n    </p>\n  "
	},
	"Description": {
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    Issuing a port command with a number higher than 255 causes the server\n    to crash. The port command may be issued before any authentication\n    takes place, meaning the attacker does not need to know a valid\n    username and password in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n    </p>\n  "
