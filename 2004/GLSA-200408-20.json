		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    There are several unspecified bugs in the QImage class which may cause\n    crashes or allow execution of arbitrary code as the user running the Qt\n    application. These bugs affect the PNG, XPM, BMP, GIF and JPEG image\n    types.\n    </p>\n  "

		"Type": "normal",
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    An attacker may exploit these bugs by causing a user to open a\n    carefully-constructed image file in any one of these formats. This may\n    be accomplished through e-mail attachments (if the user uses KMail), or\n    by simply placing a malformed image on a website and then convicing the\n    user to load the site in a Qt-based browser (such as Konqueror).\n    </p>\n  "
