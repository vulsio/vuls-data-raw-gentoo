But\n    the underlying protocols are easy to implement and attacking\n    ordinary TCP sessions is a fairly simple task. As a result, all\n    users are advised to upgrade their GAIM installation.\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        Users of GAIM 0.74 or below are affected by 7 of the\n        vulnerabilities and are encouraged to upgrade.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Users of GAIM 0.75 are affected by 11 of the vulnerabilities\n        and are encouraged to upgrade to the patched version of GAIM\n        offered by Gentoo.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Users of GAIM 0.75-r6 are only affected by\n        4 of the vulnerabilities, but are still urged to upgrade to\n        maintain security.\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  "
