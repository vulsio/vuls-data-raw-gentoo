    "Text": "\n    <p>\n    The upload handling code in Gallery places uploaded files in a\n    temporary directory. After 30 seconds, these files are deleted if they\n    are not valid images. However, since the file exists for 30 seconds, a\n    carefully crafted script could be initiated by the remote attacker\n    during this 30 second timeout. Note that the temporary directory has to\n    be located inside the webroot and an attacker needs to have upload\n    rights either as an authenticated user or via \"EVERYBODY\".\n    </p>\n  "
