	"Synopsis": "\n    The eupdatedb utility in esearch creates a file in /tmp without first\n    checking for symlinks. This makes it possible for any user to create\n    arbitrary files.\n  ",

		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    Esearch is a replacement for the Portage command \"emerge search\". It\n    uses an index to speed up searching of the Portage tree.\n    </p>\n  "

	"Description": {
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    The eupdatedb utility uses a temporary file (/tmp/esearchdb.py.tmp) to\n    indicate that the eupdatedb process is running. When run, eupdatedb\n    checks to see if this file exists, but it does not check to see if it\n    is a broken symlink. In the event that the file is a broken symlink,\n    the script will create the file pointed to by the symlink, instead of\n    printing an error and exiting.\n    </p>\n  "

	"Impact": {
		"Type": "normal",
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    An attacker could create a symlink from /tmp/esearchdb.py.tmp to a\n    nonexistent file (such as /etc/nologin), and the file will be created\n    the next time esearchdb is run.\n    </p>\n  "
