  "Background": {
    "Text": "\n    <p>\n    SSMTP is a very simple mail transfer agent (MTA) that relays mail from the\n    local machine to another SMTP host. It is not designed to function as a\n    full mail server; its sole purpose is to relay mail.\n    </p>\n  "
  },
  "Description": {
    "Text": "\n    <p>\n    There are two format string vulnerabilities inside the log_event() and\n    die() functions of ssmtp. Strings from outside ssmtp are passed to various\n    printf()-like functions from within log_event() and die() as format\n    strings. An attacker could cause a specially-crafted string to be passed to\n    these functions, and potentially cause ssmtp to execute arbitrary code.\n    </p>\n  "

  "Impact": {
    "Type": "high",
    "Text": "\n    <p>\n    If ssmtp connects to a malicious mail relay server, this vulnerability can\n    be used to execute code with the rights of the mail sender, including root.\n    </p>\n  "
