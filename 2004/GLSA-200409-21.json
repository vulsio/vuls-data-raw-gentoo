	"Background": {
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    The Apache HTTP server is one of most popular web servers on the internet.\n    mod_ssl provides SSL v2/v3 and TLS v1 support for it and mod_dav is the\n    Apache module for Distributed Authoring and Versioning (DAV).\n    </p>\n  "
	},
	"Description": {
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    A potential infinite loop has been found in the input filter of mod_ssl\n    (CAN-2004-0748) as well as a possible segmentation fault in the\n    char_buffer_read function if reverse proxying to a SSL server is being used\n    (CAN-2004-0751). Furthermore, mod_dav, as shipped in Apache httpd 2 or\n    mod_dav 1.0.x for Apache 1.3, contains a NULL pointer dereference which can\n    be triggered remotely (CAN-2004-0809). The third issue is an input\n    validation error found in the IPv6 URI parsing routines within the apr-util\n    library (CAN-2004-0786). Additionally a possible buffer overflow has been\n    reported when expanding environment variables during the parsing of\n    configuration files (CAN-2004-0747).\n    </p>\n  "
	},
	"Impact": {
		"Type": "normal",
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    A remote attacker could cause a Denial of Service either by aborting a SSL\n    connection in a special way, resulting in CPU consumption, by exploiting\n    the segmentation fault in mod_ssl or the mod_dav flaw. A remote attacker\n    could also crash a httpd child process by sending a specially crafted URI.\n    The last vulnerabilty could be used by a local user to gain the privileges\n    of a httpd child, if the server parses a carefully prepared .htaccess file.\n    </p>\n  "
