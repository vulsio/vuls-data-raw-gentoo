It is\n    available in Gentoo as a reusable library (xine-lib) with a standard\n    user interface (xine-ui).\n    </p>\n  "
	},
	"Description": {
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    Several vulnerabilities were found in xine-ui and xine-lib. By opening\n    a malicious MRL in any xine-lib based media player, an attacker can\n    write arbitrary content to an arbitrary file, only restricted by the\n    permissions of the user running the application. By opening a malicious\n    playlist in the xine-ui media player, an attacker can write arbitrary\n    content to an arbitrary file, only restricted by the permissions of the\n    user running xine-ui. Finally, a temporary file is created in an\n    insecure manner by the xine-check and xine-bugreport scripts,\n    potentially allowing a local attacker to use a symlink attack.\n    </p>\n  "

	"Impact": {
		"Type": "normal",
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    These three vulnerabilities may alow an attacker to corrupt system\n    files, thus potentially leading to a Denial of Service. It is also\n    theoretically possible, though very unlikely, to use these\n    vulnerabilities to elevate the privileges of the attacker.\n    </p>\n  "

	"Workaround": {
