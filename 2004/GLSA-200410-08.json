  "Description": {
    "Text": "\n    <p>\n    compress and uncompress do not properly check bounds on command line\n    options, including the filename. Large parameters would trigger a\n    buffer overflow.\n    </p>\n  "

    "Text": "\n    <p>\n    By supplying a carefully crafted filename or other option, an attacker\n    could execute arbitrary code on the system. A local attacker could only\n    execute code with his own rights, but since compress and uncompress are\n    called by various daemon programs, this might also allow a remote\n    attacker to execute code with the rights of the daemon making use of\n    ncompress.\n    </p>\n  "
