		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    Usermin is a web-based administration tool for Unix. It supports a wide\n    range of user applications including configuring mail forwarding,\n    setting up SSH or reading mail.\n    </p>\n  "
	},
	"Description": {
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    Usermin contains two security vulnerabilities. One fails to properly\n    sanitize email messages that contain malicious HTML or script code and\n    the other could allow an attacker to lock out a valid user by sending\n    an invalid username and password.\n    </p>\n  "
	},
	"Impact": {
		"Type": "normal",
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    By sending a specially crafted e-mail, an attacker can execute\n    arbitrary scripts running in the context of the victim's browser. This\n    can be lead to cookie theft and potentially to compromise of user\n    accounts. Furthermore, an attacker could lock out legitimate users by\n    sending invalid login information.\n    </p>\n  "
