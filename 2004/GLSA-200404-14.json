		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    According to <uri link=\"http://www.webdav.org/cadaver\">http://www.webdav.org/cadaver</uri>,\n    cadaver is a command-line WebDAV client for Unix. It supports file upload,\n    download, on-screen display, namespace operations (move/copy), collection\n    creation and deletion, and locking operations.\n    </p>\n  "
	},
	"Description": {
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    Cadaver code includes the neon library, which in versions 0.24.4 and\n    previous is vulnerable to multiple format string attacks. The latest\n    version of cadaver uses version 0.24.5 of the neon library, which makes it\n    immune to this vulnerability.\n    </p>\n  "

	"Impact": {
		"Type": "normal",
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    When using cadaver to connect to an untrusted WebDAV server, this\n    vulnerability can allow a malicious remote server to execute arbitrary code\n    on the client with the rights of the user using cadaver.\n    </p>\n  "
