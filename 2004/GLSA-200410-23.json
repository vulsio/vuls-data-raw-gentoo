	"Description": {
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    A possible buffer overflow exists in the code processing MSN SLP messages\n    (CAN-2004-0891). memcpy() was used without validating the size of the\n    buffer, and an incorrect buffer was used as destination under certain\n    circumstances. Additionally, memory allocation problems were found in the\n    processing of MSN SLP messages and the receiving of files. These issues\n    could lead Gaim to try to allocate more memory than available, resulting in\n    the crash of the application.\n    </p>\n  "
