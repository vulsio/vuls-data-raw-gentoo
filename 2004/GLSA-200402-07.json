	},
	"Description": {
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    Oliver Eikemeier of Fillmore Labs discovered the overflow in Clam AV 0.65\n    when it handled malformed UUEncoded messages, causing the daemon to shut\n    down.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    The problem originated in libclamav which calculates the line length of an\n    uuencoded message by taking the ASCII value of the first character minus 64\n    while doing an assertion if the length is not in the allowed range,\n    effectively terminating the calling program as clamav would not be\n    available.\n    </p>\n  "
