		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in the Opera web browser.\n    Opera fails to deny write access to the \"location\" browser object. An\n    attacker can overwrite methods in this object and gain script access to\n    any page that uses one of these methods. Furthermore, access to file://\n    URLs is possible even from pages loaded using other protocols. Finally,\n    spoofing a legitimate web page is still possible, despite the fixes\n    announced in GLSA 200407-15.\n    </p>\n  "
