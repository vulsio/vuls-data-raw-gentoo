  "Description": {
    "Text": "\n    <p>\n    <i>racoon</i> (a utility in the ipsec-tools package) does not verify digital\n    signatures on Phase1 packets.  This means  that anybody holding the correct\n    X.509 certificate would be able to establish a connection, even if they did\n    not have the corresponding private key.\n    </p>\n  "

  "Impact": {
    "Type": "high",
    "Text": "\n    <p>\n    Since digital signatures are not verified by the <i>racoon</i> tool, an attacker may\n\tbe able to connect to the VPN gateway and/or execute a man-in-the-middle attack.\n    </p>\n  "
