Another flaw was found when\n    arbitrary client-supplied strings can be written to the error log, allowing\n    the exploit of certain terminal emulators. A third flaw exists with the\n    mod_disk_cache module.\n  ",

		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    The Apache HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and maintain an\n    open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems.

	"Description": {
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    Three vulnerabilities were found:\n    </p>\n    <ol>\n    <li>\n    A memory leak in ssl_engine_io.c for mod_ssl in Apache 2.0.48 and below\n    allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service attack via plain\n    HTTP requests to the SSL port of an SSL-enabled server.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    Apache fails to filter terminal escape sequences from error logs that\n    begin with the ASCII (0x1B) sequence and are followed by a  series of\n    arguments. If a remote attacker could inject escape sequences into an\n    Apache error log, the attacker could take advantages of weaknesses in\n    various terminal emulators, launching attacks against remote users\n    including further denial of service attacks, file modification, and the\n    execution of arbitrary commands.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    The Apache mod_disk_cache has been found to be vulnerable to a weakness\n    that allows attackers to gain access to authentication credentials\n    through the issue of caching HTTP hop-by-hop headers which would\n    contain plaintext user passwords. There is no available resolution for\n    this issue yet.\n    </li>\n    </ol>\n  "
