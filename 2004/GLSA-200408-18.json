  "Impact": {

    "Text": "\n    <p>\n    An attacker may construct a carefully-crafted playlist file which will\n    cause xine-lib to execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the\n    user. In order to conform with the generic naming standards of most\n    Unix-like systems, playlists can have extensions other than .asx (the\n    standard xine playlist format), and made to look like another file\n    (MP3, AVI, or MPEG for example). If an attacker crafts a playlist with\n    a valid header, they can insert a VCD playlist line that can cause a\n    buffer overflow and possible shellcode execution.\n    </p>\n  "
