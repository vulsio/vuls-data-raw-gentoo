	"Synopsis": "\n    The Gallery developers have discovered a potentially serious security flaw\n    in Gallery 1.3.1, 1.3.2, 1.3.3, 1.4 and 1.4.1 which can allow a \n    remote exploit of your webserver.\n  ",

	"Description": {
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    Starting in the 1.3.1 release, Gallery includes code to simulate the behaviour\n    of the PHP 'register_globals' variable in environments where that setting\n    is disabled.  It is simulated by extracting the values of the various\n    $HTTP_ global variables into the global namespace.\n    </p>\n  "
	},
	"Impact": {
		"Type": "normal",
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    A crafted URL such as \n    http://example.com/gallery/init.php?HTTP_POST_VARS=xxx  causes the\n    'register_globals' simulation code to overwrite the $HTTP_POST_VARS which,\n    when it is extracted, will deliver the given payload. If the\n    payload compromises $GALLERY_BASEDIR then the malicious user can perform a\n    PHP injection exploit and gain remote access to the webserver with PHP \n    user UID access rights.\n    </p>\n  "
	},
	"Workaround": {
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    The workaround for the vulnerability is to replace init.php and\n    setup/init.php with the files in the following ZIP file:\n    http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/gallery/patch_1.4.1-to-1.4.1-pl1.zip?download \n    </p>\n  "
