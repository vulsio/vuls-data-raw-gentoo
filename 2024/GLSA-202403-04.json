		"Text": "\n        <p>Our current understanding of the backdoor is that is does not affect Gentoo systems, because\r\n\r\n1. the backdoor only appears to be included on specific systems and Gentoo does not qualify;\r\n2. the backdoor as it is currently understood targets OpenSSH patched to work with systemd-notify support. Gentoo does not support or include these patches;\r\n\r\nAnalysis is still ongoing, however, and additional vectors may still be identified. For this reason we are still issuing this advisory as if that will be the case.</p>\n    "
