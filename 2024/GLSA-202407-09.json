		"Text": "\n        <p>A critical vulnerability in sshd(8) was present in Portable OpenSSH\r\nversions that may allow arbitrary code execution with root privileges.\r\n\r\nSuccessful exploitation has been demonstrated on 32-bit Linux/glibc\r\nsystems with ASLR. Under lab conditions, the attack requires on\r\naverage 6-8 hours of continuous connections up to the maximum the\r\nserver will accept. Exploitation on 64-bit systems is believed to be\r\npossible but has not been demonstrated at this time. It&#39;s likely that\r\nthese attacks will be improved upon.</p>\n    "
