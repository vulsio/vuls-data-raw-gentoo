  },
  "Description": {
    "Text": "\n    <p>\n    The driver does not properly process Channel Switch Announcement\n    Information Elements, allowing for an abnormal channel change. The\n    ieee80211_input() function does not properly handle AUTH frames and the\n    driver sends unencrypted packets before WPA authentication succeeds.\n    </p>\n  "
  },
  "Impact": {
    "Type": "normal",
    "Text": "\n    <p>\n    A remote attacker could send specially crafted AUTH frames to the\n    vulnerable host, resulting in a Denial of Service by crashing the\n    kernel. A remote attacker could gain access to sensitive information\n    about network architecture by sniffing unencrypted packets. A remote\n    attacker could also send a Channel Switch Count less than or equal to\n    one to trigger a channel change, resulting in a communication loss and\n    a Denial of Service.\n    </p>\n  "
