  "Description": {
    "Text": "\n    <p>\n    Several vulnerabilities were found in PHP. Mattias Bengtsson and Philip\n    Olausson reported integer overflows in the gdImageCreate() and\n    gdImageCreateTrueColor() functions of the GD library which can cause\n    heap-based buffer overflows (CVE-2007-3996). Gerhard Wagner discovered\n    an integer overflow in the chunk_split() function that can lead to a\n    heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2007-2872). Its incomplete fix caused\n    incorrect buffer size calculation due to precision loss, also resulting\n    in a possible heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2007-4661 and\n    CVE-2007-4660). A buffer overflow in the sqlite_decode_binary() of the\n    SQLite extension found by Stefan Esser that was addressed in PHP 5.2.1\n    was not fixed correctly (CVE-2007-1887).\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    Stefan Esser discovered an error in the zend_alter_ini_entry() function\n    handling a memory_limit violation (CVE-2007-4659). Stefan Esser also\n    discovered a flaw when handling interruptions with userspace error\n    handlers that can be exploited to read arbitrary heap memory\n    (CVE-2007-1883). Disclosure of sensitive memory can also be triggered\n    due to insufficient boundary checks in the strspn() and strcspn()\n    functions, an issue discovered by Mattias Bengtsson and Philip Olausson\n    (CVE-2007-4657)\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    Stefan Esser reported incorrect validation in the FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL\n    filter of the Filter extension allowing arbitrary email header\n    injection (CVE-2007-1900). NOTE: This CVE was referenced, but not fixed\n    in GLSA 200705-19.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    Stanislav Malyshev found an error with unknown impact in the\n    money_format() function when processing \"%i\" and \"%n\" tokens\n    (CVE-2007-4658). zatanzlatan reported a buffer overflow in the\n    php_openssl_make_REQ() function with unknown impact when providing a\n    manipulated SSL configuration file (CVE-2007-4662). Possible memory\n    corruption when trying to read EXIF data in exif_read_data() and\n    exif_thumbnail() occurred with unknown impact.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    Several vulnerabilities that allow bypassing of open_basedir and other\n    restrictions were reported, including the glob() function\n    (CVE-2007-4663), the session_save_path(), ini_set(), and error_log()\n    functions which can allow local command execution (CVE-2007-3378),\n    involving the readfile() function (CVE-2007-3007), via the Session\n    extension (CVE-2007-4652), via the MySQL extension (CVE-2007-3997) and\n    in the dl() function which allows loading extensions outside of the\n    specified directory (CVE-2007-4825).\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    Multiple Denial of Service vulnerabilities were discovered, including a\n    long \"library\" parameter in the dl() function (CVE-2007-4887), in\n    several iconv and xmlrpc functions (CVE-2007-4840 and CVE-2007-4783),\n    in the setlocale() function (CVE-2007-4784), in the glob() and\n    fnmatch() function (CVE-2007-4782 and CVE-2007-3806), a floating point\n    exception in the wordwrap() function (CVE-2007-3998), a stack\n    exhaustion via deeply nested arrays (CVE-2007-4670), an infinite loop\n    caused by a specially crafted PNG image in the png_read_info() function\n    of libpng (CVE-2007-2756) and several issues related to array\n    conversion.\n    </p>\n  "
