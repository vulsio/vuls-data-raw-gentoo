He has also discovered\n    multiple other unspecified vulnerabilities in Sun JDK and Sun JRE\n    allowing unintended Java applet or application resource acquisition.\n    Additionally, a memory corruption error has been found in the handling\n    of GIF images with zero width field blocks.\n    </p>\n  "
