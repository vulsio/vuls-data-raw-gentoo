These vulnerabilities include a heap-based\n    buffer overflow in htmlentities() and htmlspecialchars() if called with\n    UTF-8 parameters, and an off-by-one error in str_ireplace(). Other\n    vulnerabilities were also found in the PHP4 branch, including possible\n    overflows, stack corruptions and a format string vulnerability in the\n    *print() functions on 64 bit systems.\n    </p>\n  "
