		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    Jonathan So reported that the airodump-ng module does not correctly\n    check the size of 802.11 authentication packets before copying them\n    into a buffer.\n    </p>\n  "
	},
	"Impact": {
		"Type": "high",
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    A remote attacker could trigger a stack-based buffer overflow by\n    sending a specially crafted 802.11 authentication packet to a user\n    running airodump-ng with the -w (--write) option. This could lead to\n    the remote execution of arbitrary code with the permissions of the user\n    running airodump-ng, which is typically the root user.\n    </p>\n  "
