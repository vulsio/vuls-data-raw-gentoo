	"Description": {
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    Nikolaos Rangos discovered a vulnerability in ClamAV which exists\n    because the recipient address extracted from email messages is not\n    properly sanitized before being used in a call to \"popen()\" when\n    executing sendmail (CVE-2007-4560). Also, NULL-pointer dereference\n    errors exist within the \"cli_scanrtf()\" function in libclamav/rtf.c and\n    Stefanos Stamatis discovered a NULL-pointer dereference vulnerability\n    within the \"cli_html_normalise()\" function in libclamav/htmlnorm.c\n    (CVE-2007-4510).\n    </p>\n  "
	},
	"Impact": {
		"Type": "high",
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    The unsanitized recipient address can be exploited to execute arbitrary\n    code with the privileges of the clamav-milter process by sending an\n    email with a specially crafted recipient address to the affected\n    system. Also, the NULL-pointer dereference errors can be exploited to\n    crash ClamAV. Successful exploitation of the latter vulnerability\n    requires that clamav-milter is started with the \"black hole\" mode\n    activated, which is not enabled by default.\n    </p>\n  "
