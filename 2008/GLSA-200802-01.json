		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    SDL_image is an image file library that loads images as SDL surfaces,\n    and supports various formats like BMP, GIF, JPEG, LBM, PCX, PNG, PNM,\n    TGA, TIFF, XCF, XPM, and XV.\n    </p>\n  "
	},
	"Description": {
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    The LWZReadByte() function in file IMG_gif.c and the IMG_LoadLBM_RW()\n    function in file IMG_lbm.c each contain a boundary error that can be\n    triggered to cause a static buffer overflow and a heap-based buffer\n    overflow. The first boundary error comes from some old vulnerable GD\n    PHP code (CVE-2006-4484).\n    </p>\n  "

	"Impact": {
		"Type": "normal",
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    A remote attacker can make an application using the SDL_image library\n    to process a specially crafted GIF file or IFF ILBM file that will\n    trigger a buffer overflow, resulting in the execution of arbitrary code\n    with the permissions of the application or the application crash.\n    </p>\n  "
