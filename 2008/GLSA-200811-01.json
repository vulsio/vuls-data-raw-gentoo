Puls II discovered\n    that Opera can produce argument strings that contain uninitialized\n    memory, when processing custom shortcut and menu commands\n    (CVE-2008-4197).</li>\n    <li>Lars Kleinschmidt discovered that Opera, when\n    rendering an HTTP page that has loaded an HTTPS page into a frame,\n    displays a padlock icon and offers a security information dialog\n    reporting a secure connection (CVE-2008-4198).</li>\n    <li>Opera does not\n    prevent use of links from web pages to feed source files on the local\n    disk (CVE-2008-4199).</li>\n    <li>Opera does not ensure that the address\n    field of a news feed represents the feed's actual URL\n    (CVE-2008-4200).</li>\n    <li>Opera does not check the CRL override upon\n    encountering a certificate that lacks a CRL (CVE-2008-4292).</li>\n    <li>Chris (Matasano Security) reported that Opera may crash if it is\n    redirected by a malicious page to a specially crafted address\n    (CVE-2008-4694).</li>\n    <li>Nate McFeters reported that Opera runs Java\n    applets in the context of the local machine, if that applet has been\n    cached and a page can predict the cache path for that applet and load\n    it from the cache (CVE-2008-4695).</li>\n    <li>Roberto Suggi Liverani\n    (Security-Assessment.com) reported that Opera's History Search results\n    does not escape certain constructs correctly, allowing for the\n    injection of scripts into the page (CVE-2008-4696).</li>\n    <li>David\n    Bloom reported that Opera's Fast Forward feature incorrectly executes\n    scripts from a page held in a frame in the outermost page instead of\n    the page the JavaScript URL was located (CVE-2008-4697).</li>\n    <li>David\n    Bloom reported that Opera does not block some scripts when previewing a\n    news feed (CVE-2008-4698).</li>\n    <li>Opera does not correctly sanitize\n    content when certain parameters are passed to Opera's History Search,\n    allowing scripts to be injected into the History Search results page\n    (CVE-2008-4794).</li>\n    <li>Opera's links panel incorrectly causes\n    scripts from a page held in a frame to be executed in the outermost\n    page instead of the page where the URL was located\n    (CVE-2008-4795).</li>\n    </ul>\n  "
