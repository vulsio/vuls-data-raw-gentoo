Furthermore, an attacker might be able to execute arbitrary\n    shell commands if \"register_globals\" is enabled, \"magic_quotes_gpc\" is\n    disabled, the PHP OpenSSL extension is not installed or loaded and the\n    file \"installation/setup.php\" has not been deleted after installation.\n    </p>\n  "
