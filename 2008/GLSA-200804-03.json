		"Type": "normal",
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    A local attacker could exploit the first vulnerability to hijack\n    forwarded X11 sessions of other users and possibly execute code with\n    their privileges, disclose sensitive data or cause a Denial of Service,\n    by binding a local X11 server to a port using only one address family.\n    The second vulnerability might allow local attackers to bypass intended\n    security restrictions and execute commands other than those specified\n    by \"ForceCommand\" if they are able to write to their home directory.\n    </p>\n  "
