  "Background": {
    "Text": "\n    <p>\n    Postfix is Wietse Venema's mailer that attempts to be fast, easy to\n    administer, and secure, as an alternative to the widely-used Sendmail\n    program.\n    </p>\n  "
  },
  "Description": {
    "Text": "\n    <p>\n    Sebastian Krahmer of SuSE has found that Postfix allows to deliver mail\n    to root-owned symlinks in an insecure manner under certain conditions.\n    Normally, Postfix does not deliver mail to symlinks, except to\n    root-owned symlinks, for compatibility with the systems using symlinks\n    in /dev like Solaris. Furthermore, some systems like Linux allow to\n    hardlink a symlink, while the POSIX.1-2001 standard requires that the\n    symlink is followed. Depending on the write permissions and the\n    delivery agent being used, this can lead to an arbitrary local file\n    overwriting vulnerability (CVE-2008-2936). Furthermore, the Postfix\n    delivery agent does not properly verify the ownership of a mailbox\n    before delivering mail (CVE-2008-2937).\n    </p>\n  "
  },
  "Impact": {
    "Type": "high",
    "Text": "\n    <p>\n    The combination of these features allows a local attacker to hardlink a\n    root-owned symlink such that the newly created symlink would be\n    root-owned and would point to a regular file (or another symlink) that\n    would be written by the Postfix built-in local(8) or virtual(8)\n    delivery agents, regardless the ownership of the final destination\n    regular file. Depending on the write permissions of the spool mail\n    directory, the delivery style, and the existence of a root mailbox,\n    this could allow a local attacker to append a mail to an arbitrary file\n    like /etc/passwd in order to gain root privileges.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    The default configuration of Gentoo Linux does not permit any kind of\n    user privilege escalation.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    The second vulnerability (CVE-2008-2937) allows a local attacker,\n    already having write permissions to the mail spool directory which is\n    not the case on Gentoo by default, to create a previously nonexistent\n    mailbox before Postfix creates it, allowing to read the mail of another\n    user on the system.\n    </p>\n  "
  },
  "Workaround": {
    "Text": "\n    <p>\n    The following conditions should be met in order to be vulnerable to\n    local privilege escalation.\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n    <li>The mail delivery style is mailbox, with the Postfix built-in\n    local(8) or virtual(8) delivery agents.</li>\n    <li>The mail spool directory (/var/spool/mail) is user-writeable.</li>\n    <li>The user can create hardlinks pointing to root-owned symlinks\n    located in other directories.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\n    Consequently, each one of the following workarounds is efficient.\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n    <li>Verify that your /var/spool/mail directory is not writeable by a\n    user. Normally on Gentoo, only the mail group has write access, and no\n    end-user should be granted the mail group ownership.</li>\n    <li>Prevent the local users from being able to create hardlinks\n    pointing outside of the /var/spool/mail directory, e.g. with a\n    dedicated partition.</li>\n    <li>Use a non-builtin Postfix delivery agent, like procmail or\n    maildrop.</li>\n    <li>Use the maildir delivery style of Postfix (\"home_mailbox=Maildir/\"\n    for example).</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\n    Concerning the second vulnerability, check the write permissions of\n    /var/spool/mail, or check that every Unix account already has a\n    mailbox, by using Wietse Venema's Perl script available in the official\n    advisory.\n    </p>\n  "
