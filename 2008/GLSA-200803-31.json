	"Description": {
		"Text": "\n    <ul><li>Two vulnerabilities were found in the Kerberos 4 support in\n    KDC: A global variable is not set for some incoming message types,\n    leading to a NULL pointer dereference or a double free()\n    (CVE-2008-0062) and unused portions of a buffer are not properly\n    cleared when generating an error message, which results in stack\n    content being contained in a reply (CVE-2008-0063).</li>\n    <li>Jeff\n    Altman (Secure Endpoints) discovered a buffer overflow in the RPC\n    library server code, used in the kadmin server, caused when too many\n    file descriptors are opened (CVE-2008-0947).</li>\n    <li>Venustech AD-LAB\n    discovered multiple vulnerabilities in the GSSAPI library: usage of a\n    freed variable in the gss_indicate_mechs() function (CVE-2007-5901) and\n    a double free() vulnerability in the gss_krb5int_make_seal_token_v3()\n    function (CVE-2007-5971).</li>\n    </ul>\n  "

	"Impact": {
		"Type": "high",
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    The first two vulnerabilities can be exploited by a remote\n    unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on the host running\n    krb5kdc, compromise the Kerberos key database or cause a Denial of\n    Service. These bugs can only be triggered when Kerberos 4 support is\n    enabled.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    The RPC related vulnerability can be exploited by a remote\n    unauthenticated attacker to crash kadmind, and theoretically execute\n    arbitrary code with root privileges or cause database corruption. This\n    bug can only be triggered in configurations that allow large numbers of\n    open file descriptors in a process.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    The GSSAPI vulnerabilities could be exploited by a remote attacker to\n    cause Denial of Service conditions or possibly execute arbitrary code.\n    </p>\n  "

		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    Kerberos 4 support can be disabled via disabling the \"krb4\" USE flag\n    and recompiling the ebuild, or setting \"v4_mode=none\" in the\n    [kdcdefaults] section of /etc/krb5/kdc.conf. This will only work around\n    the KDC related vulnerabilities.\n    </p>\n  "
