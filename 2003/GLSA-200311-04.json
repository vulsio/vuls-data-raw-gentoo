	"Description": {
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    FreeRADIUS versions below 0.9.3 are vulnerable to a heap exploit, however,\n    the attack code must be in the form of a valid RADIUS packet which limits\n    the possible exploits.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    Also corrected in the 0.9.3 release is another vulnerability which causes\n    the RADIUS server to de-reference a NULL pointer and crash when an\n    Access-Request packet with a Tunnel-Password is received.\n    </p>\n  "
