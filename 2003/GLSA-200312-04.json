		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    CVS, which stands for Concurrent Versions System, is a client/server\n    application which tracks changes to sets of files.  It allows multiple users\n    to work concurrently on files, and then merge their changes back into the\n    main tree (which can be on a remote system).  It also allows branching, or\n    maintaining separate versions for files.\n    </p>\n  "

Stable releases contain only bug\n    fixes from previous versions of CVS. This release fixes a security issue\n    with no known exploits that could cause previous versions of CVS to attempt\n    to create files and directories in the filesystem root. This release also\n    fixes several issues relevant to case insensitive filesystems and some other\n    bugs. We recommend this upgrade for all CVS clients and servers!\"\n    </p>\n  "
