		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    Two flaws have been found in GnuPG 1.2.3.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    First, ElGamal signing keys can be compromised.  These keys are not commonly\n    used, but this is \"a significant security failure which can lead to a\n    compromise of almost all ElGamal keys used for signing.  Note that this is a\n    real world vulnerability which will reveal your private key within a few\n    seconds\".\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    Second, there is a format string flaw in the 'gpgkeys_hkp' utility which\n    \"would allow a malicious keyserver in the worst case to execute an arbitrary\n    code on the user's machine.\"\n    </p>\n  "

	"Impact": {
		"Type": "minimal",
		"Text": "\n    <p>\n    If you have used ElGamal keys for signing your private key can be\n    compromised, and a malicious keyserver could remotely execute arbitrary code\n    with the permissions of the user running gpgkeys_hkp.\n    </p>\n  "
